I received my B.Sc. degree in Computer Engineering from Middle East Technical University in 2022. I also finished my double major in Mathematics in the same year. 

Currently, I am studying towards an M.Sc. degree in Computer Science at Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne, with an expected graduation in July 2024. Simultaneously, I am working as a part-time backend engineer at Edge Delta.

My research interests include Computer Graphics, 3D Vision, Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, and Image Processing.
