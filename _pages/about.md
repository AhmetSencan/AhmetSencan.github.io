I graduated with flying colors from the esteemed Middle East Technical University, armed with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering. But that's not all! I couldn't resist the allure of numbers and equations, so I took up Mathematics as a daring double major, giving my mind a feast of problem-solving challenges!

Fast forward to now, and I find myself embarking on an exhilarating adventure at Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne, where I'm pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science! 

Moreover, I'm also flexing my skills as a Part-time Backend Engineer at Edge Delta. Working there has exposed me to real-world challenges and innovative solutions, pushing my creativity and technical prowess to the limits.

Oh, and let's not forget my current research interests! I'm diving headfirst into captivating fields like Computer Graphics, 3D Vision, Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, and Image Processing.
